Thanks for purchasing this pakage.

The scene that was used for the online webplayer DEMO is included in this package.


There are two custom scripts that are being used to achieve the desired effects on the pre-fabs.
MaterialAlphaPulse & ObjectConstantRotation


MaterialAlphaPulse is used to generate the pulsating glyphs.
Particles/Additive shaders needs to be used with this script.
What the script also does, it on runtime creates another instance of the material so that when the user edited the colour,
it does not change the base material.



Using MaterialAlphaPulse:
Drag onto item.
size - add the amount of children the item would have that this might be applied to.
Example is the animated obilisk that has 4 children pulsating surfaces underneath it
If only itself then type 1
Drag each of the children or iteself onto the Element lines
Colour_pick your desired hue and saturation
Adjust Change_speed and Max_alpha's to adjust the colour result

NB!!!, in the editor the colour keeps displaying as white, this changes to the picked colour at run-time



Using ObjectConstantRotation
Drag onto item.
size - add the amount of children the item would have that this might be applied to.
Example is the animated obilisk that has 4 children pulsating surfaces underneath it
If only itself then type 1
Drag each of the children or iteself onto the Element lines
Adjust the axis of rotation and the speed
positive numbers = clockwise rotation
negative numbers = an anti-clockwise

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website
Let me know what other tower types you might want to see in future?

Enjoy
